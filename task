Create a function to compare for the Nth term of a given array of geometric sequence such that;
the function takes three parameters (array of geometric sequence, first term, required Nth term)

1. array of geometric sequence: this is a sequence that must not really begin with the first term

2. first term: this is the first value that begins the original sequence.

3. required Nth term: this is the requested value of Nth position in the sequence.


example:
	
	from a geometric sequence type of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 

	and function parameter of ([8, 16, 32, 64], 2, 9)

	where [8, 16, 32, 64] is any portion of the geometric sequence

	2 is the first number of the sequence, 1st Term

	9 is a 9th term or position in the sequence.  which should return 512




 Samples:

 	([81, 243, 729, 2187], 1, 3) => 9
 	([7, 14, 28, 56], 7, 7) => 448
 	([0, 0, 0, 0], 0, 10) => 0







note:
if result is a decimal of more than 6 decimal place, truncate it to 6 decimal place.
